> This example showed the output of `fahrenheit_to_celsius` assigned to `temp_C`, which
> is then passed to `celsius_to_kelvin` to get the final result. It is also possible
> to perform this calculation in one line of code, by "nesting" one function call
> inside another, like so:
>
> ```{r chained-example}
> # freezing point of water in Fahrenheit
> celsius_to_kelvin(fahrenheit_to_celsius(32.0))
> ```
> Here, we call `fahrenheit_to_celsius` to convert `32.0` from Fahrenheit to
> Celsius, and immediately pass the value returned from `fahrenheit_to_celsius`
> to `celsius_to_kelvin` to convert from Celsius to Kelvin. Our conversion
> from Fahrenheit to Kelvin is done, all in one go!
>
> This is convenient, but you should be careful not to nest too many function
> calls at once - it can become confusing and difficult to read!

> ## Create a Function
>
> In the last lesson, we learned to **c**ombine elements into a vector using the `c` function,
> e.g. `x <- c("A", "B", "C")` creates a vector `x` with three elements.
> Furthermore, we can extend that vector again using `c`, e.g. `y <- c(x, "D")` creates a vector `y` with four elements.
> Write a function called `highlight` that takes two vectors as arguments, called
> `content` and `wrapper`, and returns a new vector that has the wrapper vector
> at the beginning and end of the content:
>
> ```{r, echo=-1}
> highlight <- function(content, wrapper) {
>    answer <- c(wrapper, content, wrapper)
>    return(answer)
> }
> best_practice <- c("Write", "programs", "for", "people", "not", "computers")
> asterisk <- "***"  # R interprets a variable with a single value as a vector
>                    # with one element.
> highlight(best_practice, asterisk)
> ```

> If the variable `v` refers to a vector, then `v[1]` is the vector's first element and `v[length(v)]` is its last (the function `length` returns the number of elements in a vector).
> Write a function called `edges` that returns a vector made up of just the first and last elements of its input:
>
> ```{r, echo=-1}
> edges <- function(v) {
>    first <- v[1]
>    last <- v[length(v)]
>    answer <- c(first, last)
>    return(answer)
> }
> dry_principle <- c("Don't", "repeat", "yourself", "or", "others")
> edges(dry_principle)
> ```

> > ## Solution

> >    first <- v[1]
> >    last <- v[length(v)]
> >    answer <- c(first, last)
