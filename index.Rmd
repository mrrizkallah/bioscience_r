# What is R

R is both a programming language and software environment for statistical computing, which is free and open-source (<https://www.r-project.org/about.html>).

The \emph{R Project} was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka (University of Auckland) in the early 1990s as a different implementation of the S language, which was developed at Bell Laboratories.

Since 1997, R has been developed by the \emph{R Development Core Team}.

R is platform independent and can run on Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Unix/Linux systems.

## Getting Started
To get started, you'll need to install two pieces of software:

- R, the actual programming language. <https://cran.r-project.org>

- RStudio, an excellent IDE for working with R. <https://www.rstudio.com>

Why RStudio?\footnote{\scriptsize You must have installed R before using RStudio.}

- Easier to use (everything is in one space)

- Many useful integrations (e.g. R-projects, R-markdown, shiny ...)

- Plenty of shortcuts (alt + shift + k)

- Plenty of cheatsheets (see top panel)

## Glossary
- **command**: user input (text or numbers) that R understands

- **script**: a sequence of commands collected in a text file, each separated by a new line

- **environment**: a list of named variables that we have generated/imported by means of a series of commands

- **history**: the list of past commands thaty we have used

- **help**: a documentation of all the functions available in R (the user manual)

- **package**: a collection of additional functions and dataset

```{r knit_exit, include=F, echo=F}
knit_exit()
```
